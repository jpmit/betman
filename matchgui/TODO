# list of easy things TODO when I need a break or to waste an hour or two

- don't allow menu frames to be opened multiple times
- allow changing timebase in global config
- make everything prettier
- make sure we are saving prices to the DB
- make viewing current strategies scrollable vertically
- make RHS of strategy monitor scrollable

# other

* when calling GetMUBets, partially matched bets split into a matched
  bet and an unmatched bet (see below): we need to parse these
  properly
* add agressive setting(s) to MM strategy 
* figure out why GetMUBets is very slow
* figure out why my SP bets aren't matching
- add cancelling capabilities for both BDAQ and BF
- add getting market information so we have a time series of GBP matched on market
- save complete state (strategies, automations etc.) when exit, and load this when startup
- add filters for strategies so that bets are only placed if each bet is below risk limits
- improve matching markets engine
- Make automations configurable
- global position monitoring (probably in models.py)
- viewer/backtester, either in current GUI or as separate GUI app
- add market volume to engine and/or GUI
- sort out how and when info is written to the DB
- GUI frame to select which markets we want when putting in hautomation
- docstring and comment consistently
- clean up code
- make proper (LaTeX?) documentation
