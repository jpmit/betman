# list of easy things TODO when I need a break or to waste an hour or two

- don't allow menu frames to be opened multiple times
- allow changing timebase in global config
- flush strategy info through to monitor panel immediately (don't wait for next update)
- make everything prettier
- make sure we are saving prices to the DB

# other

- save complete state (strategies, automations etc.) when exit, and load this when startup
- fix how the models are managed, especially those that should be singletons
- improve matching markets engine
- Make automations configurable
- global position monitoring (probably in models.py)
- viewer/backtester, either in current GUI or as separate GUI app
