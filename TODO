storing 'inrunning' correctly for BDAQ but for BF we are storing the
market status in this, e.g. whether the market is 'active', that is
accepting bets.  These are two very different things.

Figure out a way to write code so that when importing 'bfapi.py', we
don't login automatically, i.e. we have to call bfapi.Login() and it
automatically updates the session token for the other methods.
