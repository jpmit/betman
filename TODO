Proper TODO List

18th July 2013 

Currently there is a 'bug' in that in the Market objects we are

market status in this, e.g. whether the market is 'active', that is
accepting bets.  These are two very different things.

ParseEventSubTree in bdaqapiparse.py returns markets more than once
depending on nesting..
